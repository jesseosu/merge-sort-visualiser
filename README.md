# Merge Sort Visualizer

This is a simple and interactive web application that visualizes the **Merge Sort** algorithm. The project allows you to see how Merge Sort works step-by-step by dynamically sorting a randomly generated array of bars. The bars move and change height as the sorting algorithm divides and merges the array.

## Features

- Visualizes the **Merge Sort** algorithm in action.
- Allows you to control the speed of sorting and the size of the array using sliders.
- Bars are displayed in a way that helps you visualize the sorting process.
- Interactive UI for starting the sorting process.

## How to Use

1. **Start Sorting**:
   - Click the **Start Sorting** button to begin the merge sort process.
   
2. **Speed Control**:
   - Use the **Speed** slider to control how fast or slow the sorting process should be.
   - The lower the value, the faster the sorting process.

3. **Array Size Control**:
   - Use the **Array Size** slider to adjust the number of elements in the array.
   - The number of bars will increase or decrease depending on your selection.

4. **View the Visualization**:
   - Watch as the array is divided into smaller subarrays and then merged back together in sorted order.
   - The bars will change color to indicate the steps of the sorting process.
